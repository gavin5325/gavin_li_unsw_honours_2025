# About this directory

This directory contains scripts for performing RNA velocity analysis on the genotype (ZMYND8 WT/KO) specific annData objects generated from the previous step. Analysis was performed on UNSWâ€™s HPC cluster Katana (DOI: 10.26190/669X-A286).

`250621_RNA_velocity.ipynb`: Initial RNA velocity with all the subsetted objects from 250702_seurat_no_day_60.R. 

`250702_seurat_no_day_60.ipynb`: Performs RNA velocity on WT, KO and combined objects once D60 has been aligned to hg19.
