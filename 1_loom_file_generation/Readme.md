250424_Velocyto_organoidB2478.sh performs the first round of read alignment using velocyto to generate spliced, unspliced and ambiguous loom count matrices across D20, 60 and 100 WT and KO samples using hg38.

250725_D60_hg19.sh is an additional round of read alignment just for aligning D60 WT and KO samples to hg19, which is the version used in the upstream CellRanger pipeline.
